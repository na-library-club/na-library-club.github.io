		<h3>Events</h3>
		<p>All of the events listed below are not required, you can do all or none, it is completely up to you.</p>
		
		<h4>Secret Santa:</h4>
		<p>We fill out a google form that asks what our favorite genre and books are, then they are randomly distrbutied to the members and we have to choose a book in the library that we think they would like. We usally do it around Christmas, recive your book before winter break, read it over the break, and guess when we get back.</p>
		
		<h4>Book Pun Baking:</h4>
		<p>You bake some sort of treat, and put or incoperate puns into them.</p>
		
		<h4>Monthly Book Read:</h4>
		<p>Just like every book club. You choose a book you want to read as a group and read a bit in between every meeting.</p>
		
		<h4>Arts and Crafts:</h4>
		<p>Just choose to do arts and crafts. Like making displays for the library, making paper decorations, or even just rating books for the other students in the school.<br>

		<h4>Puzzles:</h4>
		<p>Stressful week, no problem we have a puzzle out every day, and if you don't feel like doing anything hard just do a puzzle. Do it alone or do it with friends, but usally a fun puzzle fixes everything.</p>
		
		<h4>Book Scavenger Hunt:</h4>
		<p>Write clues about different books in the library and lead people on a scavenger hunt with different books to see if they can find the winning book. Prize can be whatever you decide.</p>
